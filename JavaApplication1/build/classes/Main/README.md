Bilkent Section Change Project
The application provides easy management of the registration period for Bilkent students. The users will be able to change the sections of the subjects according to their request by checking the availability of the user's schedule. The main design will consist of a user interface that will allow users to have subjects and their schedules that will also be implemented considering the limits of the current courses. Users should create single and multiple section change requests in our third-party program. They will be in queue accordingly to their request timing, and if available, the program will perform the action. There will also be a forum for people to create and view the exchange section requests. Suppose another user in the targetted section accepts the requests. In that case, action will be performed automatically to exchange the sections of the subjects between those two people who gave the request and approved the request. In addition, the program will inform users of the changes if it concerns the user's requests. If they desire, they can also be notified for various reasons, such as when the targetted section has an available quota or a targetted exchange order in the forum.
